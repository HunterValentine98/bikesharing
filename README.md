# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
In this project, we are looking at bike sharing data from Citibike. We are tasked with creating visualizations to portray how often the bikes are used as well as various other things.


## Results
![Checkout Times for Users](CheckoutTimes.png)
- The average checkout time looks to be around 10 minutes with a steep decline after that.
![Checkout Times by Gender](CheckoutTimesGender.png)
- With orange being unknown, it does appear that more men ride bikes than women, and every graph follows roughly the same shape (No change in checkout variation based on Gender).
![Trips by Weekday for Each Hour](Trips.png)
- The peak ride times appear during rush hour (7-8 AM and 5-6 PM).
![Trips By Gender](TripsGender.png)
- Men and women look to follow similar bike ride times, with the women graph being more faded because there is less women who ride bikes.
![User Trips by Gender](UserTrips.png)
- A large majority of the riders appear to be subscribers versus normal customers.
![Top Starting Locations](Starting'.png)
- A large majority of the start locations are in lower and mid Manhattan.
![Top Ending Locations](Ending.png)
- Similar to above, the ending locations are much bigger in the Manhattan area.
